# CircuitPython code for Q-Pack Proton Pack (or any pack, really)

There are several existing Proton Pack electronics kits, but I really just wanted to use CircuitPython.

This code is expecting to be implemented on an [Adafruit Prop-Maker RP2040 Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico/overview)

#### Things left to do:

- [ ] Implement "overheating" logic
